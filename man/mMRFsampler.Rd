\title{
Samples from a meMRF}
\description{
Samples from a mixed exponential Markov random field.}
\usage{
mMRFsampler(n, type, lev, graph, nIter = 1000, thresh)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
Number of samples
}
  \item{type}{
p x 1 vector specifying the type of distribution for each variable ("g" = Gaussian, "p" = Poisson, "e" = Exponential, "c" = Categorical)
}
  \item{lev}{
p x 1 vector specifying the number of levels for each variables (for continuous variables: 1)
}
  \item{graph}{
A p x p symmetric (weighted) adjacency matrix
}
  \item{nIter}{
Iterations in the Gibbs Sampler
}
  \item{thresh}{
A list in which each entry corresponds to a variable; categorical variables have as many thresholds as categories
}
}
\details{
In case of interactions involving categorical variables with more than m=2 categories, there are more than one one parameter describing the interaction. As we use the overcomplete representation, in case of an interaction between two categorical variables, we have m^2 parameters, in case of an interaction between a cateogircal and a continuous variable we have m parameters. In case of Catogorical-Categorical interactions, we use the Potts-parameterization (see e.g. Wainwright & Jordan, 2009), where the value of all non-zero parameters is given bei the weighted adjacency matrix. In case of Categorical-Continous interactions, parameters for categories m > |m|/2 have a nonzero parameter with the value is given by the weighted adjacency matrix. All categories m >=  |m|/2 have zero parameters. Please note that this mapping is absolutely arbitrary. In the offical release of the package, the user will be able to specify the mapping herself.

\examples{

n <- 10 # number of samples
type <- c("g", "c") # one Gaussian, one categorical
lev <- c(1,3) # the categorical variable has 3 categories
graph <- matrix(0,2,2) 
graph[1,2] <- graph[2,1] <- .5 # we have an edge with weight .5 between the two nodes
thresh <- list(c(0), c(0,0,0)) # all thresholds are zero (for the categorical variables each categoriy has a threshold)
data <- mMRFsampler(n, type, lev, graph, nIter=1000, thresh)
